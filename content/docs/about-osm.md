To maximize the re-usability of the data Cyclofix collects, we decided to use [OpenStreetMap](https://welcome.openstreetmap.org/). But why? How does OSM help us with that?

In short: OSM is the Wikipedia of maps. Anyone can improve and view all data on the map, unlike most commercial maps.
We collected some resources that delve deeper into this topic:

- korte intro
- link naar intro-videos en paginas
- link naar intro over OSM voor overheden
- link naar intro wiki page osm voor overheid
