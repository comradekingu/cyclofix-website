How do you set up a mapathon to speed up the data inventory? Below you can find some helpful tips to get started.

TO DO: include some links and images


### Decide on an event model

* online introduction (with optional meeting point)
* on the street mapping
* post-event socializing
* ...


### Before the event

- decide on event model; get a location if needed
- decide on registrations (cf. Eventbrite)
- decide on an area of focus
- how to devide the work?
-- we created a simple map to say "I will map here", then pushed people to go somewhere where no-one else was going
-- more structural approaches are possible 
- create a video introduction
- set up a live video channel for help
- mistake we made: only in the reminder mail did we give detailed info about what exactly to expect
- create some buzz!
- finish the app 15 minutes before the event


### During the event
- make sure people have a help-line
- make sure you can start collecting feedback
- be prepared for live data analysis (because that makes it FUN)


### After the event
- be prepared for data clean-up
- send a thank you email
- send a follow-up email with project status after a little while
