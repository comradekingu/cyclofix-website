# Preparation

TODO: include some links and images

## Decide on an event model

* online intro (with optional meeting point)
* on the street mapping
* post even socializing

## Before the event

- decide on event model; get a location if needed
- decide on registrations (we used Eventbrite)
- decide on an area of focus
- how to devide the work?
-- we created a simple map to say "I will work here", then pushed people to go somewhere where no-one else was going
-- more structural approaches are possible too
- created a video introduction
- set up a live video channel for help
- mistake we made: only in the reminder mail did we give detailed info about what exactly to expect
- build buzz
- finish the app 15 minutes before the event

## During event
- make sure people have a help-line
- make sure you can start collecting feedback
- be prepared for live data analysis (because that makes it FUN)

## After the event
- be prepared for data clean-up
- send a thank you
- send a follow-up with project status after a little while
