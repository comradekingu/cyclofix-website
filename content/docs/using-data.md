### Buying a new bike

- most places to buy a bicycle are `shop=bicycle`
- however, we need to exclude bicycle repair shops etc. These can be removed: exclude `service:bicycle:retail=no`

- but you can buy bikes at some other places as well. For example, special concepts like "cycle caf√©s" (`amenity=cafe`, `amenity=pub`), clubs or non-profits, or general sports shops that also sell bicycles
