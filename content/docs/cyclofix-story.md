Let us tell you a little story. Imagine a warm summer day with a gentle breeze. You decide to go for a cycling trip and happen to cross the Brussels Capital Region. Suddenly, however, you hear a silent hiss, you look down and notice a flat tire (*starts cursing*). Sounds familiar, right? 

In the rare condition that you happen to have a bicycle pump with you, you are stuck. So what do you do? You take out your phone and start looking for an answer on the mental question "Where can I find the nearest pump to get me back on track?". It would surprise you that chances are that the nearest pump Google Maps or any other website gives you isn't the nearest at all.

Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people interested in cycling has grown exponentially, making the need for information about where to buy and maintain a bicycle more relevant than ever. And CycloFix is trying to meet that need...

## What was the problem?

The biggest issue at stake here is that there is a great need for (open) data about cycling infrastructure and other points of interest that can be relevant for cyclists. Think about bicycle pumps, repair stations, bike shops, public parkings and so on. Especially in a bureaucratic and fragmented area like Brussels, with multiple governments on different levels, such a data inventory can be a hard nut to crack.
