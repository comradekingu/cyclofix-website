Open Source can only work when it's well-documented and the vision crystal-clear, enabling others to [build upon our work](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete). Here you can find all necessary documentation if you want to get started with the tool yourself, as well as a [blogpost describing the vision and the origin of the CycloFix project](/docs/cyclofix-story).

To use our map on your own site (to show off your city's amazing bicycle infrastructure), check out "[embed on your website](/docs/using-data-map/#embed-on-your-website)".
