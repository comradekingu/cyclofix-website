Open Source can only work when it's well-documented and the vision crystal-clear, enabling others to build upon our work. Here you can find all necessary documentation if you want to get started with the tool yourself, as well as a blogpost describing the vision and the origin of the CycloFix project.

TO DO (?):
* basic datamodel explanation + overpass query > integrate in 'using data'?
* (link to mapcomplete website (and create your own quest))
