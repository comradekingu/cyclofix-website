# CycloFix

Welcome to the CycloFix website! CycloFix is a project that saw the light of day during the 10th edition of Open Summer of Code, a 4-week summer programme where students, coaches and organisations develop innovative open source projects.

The goal of the CycloFix project, funded by Brussels Mobility, was to come up with a solution to map, present and integrate cycling infrastructure and relevant points of interests (bicycle pumps, repair stations, parkings, bike shops, ...) in the Brussels Capital Region. Therefore, a mapping tool was developped using MapComplete that enables every user to add and/or edit data directly in OpenStreetMap.
