# CycloFix

CycloFix is a project that saw the light of day during the 10th edition of [Open Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.be), a 4-week summer programme where students, coaches and organisations develop innovative open source projects.

The goal of the CycloFix project, funded by [Brussels Mobility](https://mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels/en), was to come up with a solution to map, present and integrate cycling infrastructure and relevant points of interests (bicycle pumps, repair stations, parking, bike shops, ...) in the Brussels Capital Region. Therefore, a mapping tool was developed using MapComplete that enables every user to add and/or edit data directly in OpenStreetMap.

The mapping tool, together with all documentation, can be found [here](https://cyclofix.osm.be). Detailed information about MapComplete and other examples can be found here [here](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete).
